Koji Chatbot is your personal task manager and assistant that helps you keep track of your tasks, deadlines, events, and more. With an intuitive interface, you can easily add, update, edit, and find tasks using simple commands.

## Adding Deadlines

To add a deadline, use the `deadline` command followed by the task description and the deadline date/time. The date must be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

**Example:**

deadline return book /by 2023-12-31 1800

**Expected output:**

Got it. I've added this task: [D][ ] return book (by: Dec 31 2023, 6:00 PM) Now you have X tasks in the list.


## Marking and Unmarking Tasks

To mark a task as done, type:

mark TASK_NUMBER

For example:

mark 2

**Expected output:**

Nice! I've marked this task as done: [E][X] study sesh (from: Feb 01 2019, 12:00 am to: Dec 12 2020, 6:00 pm) Now you have X tasks in the list.

To unmark a task, type:

unmark TASK_NUMBER

For example:

unmark 2

**Expected output:**

OK, I've marked this task as not done yet: [E][] study sesh (from: Feb 01 2019, 12:00 am to: Dec 12 2020, 6:00 pm) Now you have X tasks in the list.


## Editing Tasks

To update a task's details without deleting it, use the `edit` command:

edit TASK_NUMBER NEW_DESCRIPTION

edit 3 Submit IP report


This command updates the description of the task at position 3.

## Finding Tasks

To search for tasks containing a specific keyword, use:

find KEYWORD

**Example:**

find book 

**Expected output:**

Here are the matching tasks in your list:

1. [T][ ] study lac4202
2. [D][X] return book (by: Dec 31 2023, 6:00 PM)

## Adding Events

To add an event with a start and end time, use the `event` command:

event project meeting /from 2023-10-15 1400 /to 2023-10-15 1600

**Expected output:**

Got it. I've added this task: [E][ ] project meeting (from: Oct 15 2023, 2:00 PM to: Oct 15 2023, 4:00 PM) Now you have X tasks in the list.

## Deleting Tasks

To delete a task, use the `delete` command:

delete TASK_NUMBER

**Example:**

delete 2

**Expected output:**

Noted. I've removed this task: [D][X] return book (by: Dec 31 2023, 6:00 PM) Now you have X tasks in the list.


## Command Format Notes

- **Parameters in UPPER_CASE** indicate values that should be supplied by the user.  
  For example, in `deadline <desc> /by yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`, `<desc>` is the task description.
- **Square brackets** indicate optional parameters.  
  E.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used with or without a tag.
- **Items with "â€¦"** indicate that the parameter can be repeated (including zero times).
- **Parameters can be in any order.**
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.
- When copying multi-line commands from this document, be cautious of line breaks and extra spaces.
